Here you will find information on ONIX headstages. We hope that there will be
community additions to this list. Implementing your own headstage that
incorporates other sensors (e.g cameras, temperature, etc), or even custom
ASICs (e.g. next gen ephys probes), is quite simple and you have automatic
integration with all the other headstages and hardware that exist in the
ONI/ONIX ecosystem.

.. note:: If you're interested in creating a custom headstage that "just works"
    with existing ONIX hardware and software, please get in touch using the links
    on the :ref:`support` page.
